        the folder but don't want to create the folder then you
        should append a slash at the end of the path. Example: ./folder/

        If set to "true" it'll only set ACL for changed objects, which is
        way faster to do than to check and set every objects' ACL.

        Generally, you can keep this option on "yes" to get a speed boost,
        and you should only change it to "false" if you changed the
        ACL option (in order to force set every object's ACL to the specified one).
